# Log spam (0.6.x Only)

Some error or exceptions may occur that cause OpenTabletDriver to spam logs in chat until the daemon itself crash.
If you use an RPC server or client, make sure you properly handle potential RPC exceptions.
If you are not using RPC and the issue still persists, complain to Infinity.
